# Task: Claimer Identification

## Algorithm

### Input

- Token contract address
- Distributor wallet address
- Airdrop Dates

### Steps

- Modify the base query on Dune to adjust the specific airdrop session
  - Note that each airdrop has its own qualification criteria, which changes the query participants
    - Examples: [Eigen query](https://dune.com/queries/3719372/6257457), [Degen Query](https://dune.com/queries/3406042/5717097)

### Output

- List of wallet addresses that claim airdrops

## TODO

- Implement the base query in Python with Dune API

## Documentation

- Documentation will be added
